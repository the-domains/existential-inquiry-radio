# Through many younger years, I slow-cooked...

...over the
concern that enduring tribulation might somehow burn away the best parts of me
--that by suffering a difficult job or committing to a real relationship
whatever soul I had might just wither away.

Saying that now, though, I can see poor construction of the idea and easily peel it back to reveal the raw child-bones of fear I used to prop it up. Looking at life now, the notion eats its own tail in the face of this simple question: What is the better forge for a soul --the fire and the hammer or the comfortable sofa?

I know my soul now -- at 37, so far -- yet looking back through many years where I did not feel it or trust in such a meta-mythical creature like a soul, I can see how easy it is during dark times to let this sense of one's Celestial Self slip away --natural, in fact, like falling asleep through long nights. Yet, like the sun, Souls remain shining, awaiting our next dawn turn, when we will stir and reawaken to their warm bright offering. The trick, then, is to trust in the immutable steadiness of that light.

There is an unfathomable Well -deep in the earth beneath your feet right now- that does not run dry, that cannot be glutted with stones.

When next you feel tossed and lost, remember that the vehicle of your awareness in this world - a scaffold of flesh and bones that tires, that hungers, that angers and aches - is quite convincing with its evidence that your feet stop at the soles...

But you and I know different. We know about the taproots that run deep -that we can plant our feet and feel them, send our awareness down down down to the glowing font that nourishes our urge to serve our compatriots in this world. We know this Well to be true, my friend, because we have been mysteriously sustained by it for most of our lives. The times we have not felt its radical energy were only the trick of a convincing physical world in which we fell prey to elaborate distractions, in which we exhausted ourselves wrestling to control outcomes instead of simply loving the unknown and letting the wild energy climb up through our roots and pour forth as shining Show Up.

It's okay to be tired---please sleep well. It's okay to feel hurt or sad or angry--please offer yourself generous grace and gratitude for what feeling you have. Be kind to your physical body and its limits, to your emotional body and its primal reactions. Each of these is a relevant bit of the tale of who you've been AND who you're becoming. The gift of self-care is a gift to the world because it sustains your dynamic possibility here among us.

It's okay to fail---when we imagine it's only okay to succeed, we shut our eyes and miss the fascinating secrets revealed when things fall apart.

It's okay to not get everything done---our best laid plans for tomorrow are always quiet fictions, just flat maps that won't capture the landscape we'll be walking through when tomorrow becomes today.

It's okay that we've been mostly running on instinct---it has gotten us this far.

And it's okay to Awaken, even slowly, gradually. It's okay to slip back into slumber a bit---this kind of Awake can take some getting used to.

Yet, it is time to Root and Rise. Time to do the work the only You, whole with Soul, can do while you're here, now.

We can draw from the Well with intention. We can turn our face to the sun and soak up the shine of our souls to warm and green these coming days. We can take the steps of giants now, beyond instinct to a new level of love, cause, and possibility for our lives and for this world as agents of the Universe.
