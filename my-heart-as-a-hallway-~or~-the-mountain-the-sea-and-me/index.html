<h2>~or~ The Mountain, the Sea, and Me</h2><p>I've recently begun to think of my heart as a hallway -as if <strong>e</strong><strong>very moment of this life is a gift to be received, loved, and let go. </strong>Ideally, I welcome each experience to enter, pass through and exit with kindness and free of judgment. Gratitude, Grace and Generosity brace the structure and hold this passage open. My existence takes on a mythical Flow. </p><p>Yet how can I not balk at loving some of these harsh moments? Sometimes grace grates my throat, I reach for generosity and scrape the barrel's bottom, and some broken bit of an early Me stomps in protest of the ludicrous expectation that we could be grateful for some specific shadow of hell cast upon us by an uncaring world.</p><p>Fear, anger, resentment, and doubt contract the corridor. An unexpected boulder bashes its way through my careful construct. My mindful practice cracks and crumbles. Struts of awareness, acceptance and appreciation explode in showers of wicked splinters. This hallway heart of mine collapses around me...</p><p>***</p><p>I tumble into tunnels, claxons, and flashing red -the mad dark dreams of Damage Control.</p><p><strong>Through this place, now, nothing Flows. </strong>Rough grains of trauma settle to the floor in a layer of sedimentary irritant. In triage, my hardened heart coats, layers, and smooths each pain, making a pile of wicked little pearls. With a sense of tremendous treasure lost, I - the Cave Beast - gather them up. Some are stashed away; a few distinct ones are selected to adorn this brutal, reactionary body -pretty twinkles in the shadows, poor reminders and vague memorials to light.</p><p>Inside the mouth of my cave, flinching at the distant flash and boom of life streaming past, I raise the clutched hurts I've harbored for their simple shine.</p><p>"Look who I am," I roar to the storm.<strong>"I've been damaged in tragic ways and my outrage defines me! My wounds make me unique and inspire my clever cynicism. I need no more wild promises; I'm rich enough here draped in my own special pains."</strong></p><p>Guarding a case of burnished baubles in the dark corners of a stagnant cave, I am sheltered from the chaotic storm <em>out there</em>.</p><p>* * *</p><picture>

<p>Then some stray ray of light strikes my secret eye -<em>the eye the Cave Beast cannot close</em>. A beckoning of bluest sky beyond my hiding hole reminds me of a familiar body bigger this Beast. I blink, stir and reawaken from this level of dream. <em>I am no</em><em>t in a cave</em>. I AM the damned cave. <strong>I am not merely Cave Beast--I am an entire mountain that harbors and holds it, </strong>that lovingly cradles its mousy howl and its tiny glinting trinkets.</p><p>I breathe in and notice a rhythmic pulse, pumping energy through veins of gold and silver. I remember grand muscles and stretch them around deep crystal bones. I sense the work of a vast, visceral anatomy.</p><p>As I stir, all those dark details shrink to simple background noise. My time in the cave was not an earned punishment, nor the doom of a despairing world. It was just me being small -slipping into a sleep-body while a greater one rested. <strong>There is warmth and welcome out there streaming down on the vast wild skin bounding my physical space in the world <em>regardless of how awake I am</em>. </strong>If I don't feel it, well, I must be dreaming of a hurt animal holed up in the safety of a secret heart, having once again ceded the risk of exposed skin.</p><p>I breathe in and fill myself with elements forged in the hearts of stars.</p><p>To live small is to pretend this should be easy, to paint fear as patience for perfect timing, to see failure as a greater sin than not trying, to simply skim the the bold print and crib your answers from someone else's test. To live small is to imagine any single unit of matter or moment could be precious, while the ego-shattering treasure of <em>just Being Here as a Witness at all </em>goes unnoticed.</p><p><strong>To live <em>to the skin </em>is to accept pain and struggle as a rock-bottom price for the chance to dance among ancient stones, to sing new verses in the Ballad of Human Connection, to scratch fresh magic in the Spellbook of Life.</strong></p><p>So why not live <em>to the skin? </em>Why not live BIG? This lifetime is our window to cast our drops of awakening into the unfathomable ocean of Universe-awareness. Once they plunk in, who can then point to any single one? Each edge and boundary disappears. Our contributions have become both part and whole of something infinite.</p><p>I breathe in and realize <strong>I am both the mountain and the sea that laps at its feet. </strong>I present my <em>Show Up</em>on behalf of the Universe as a part of the Welcoming Committee to all the life around me.</p><p>Hello, my love, I'm so glad you're here. With your kid fears, fierce hopes, scribbled scars, and self-styled truths, <strong>did you know you are dazzling?</strong></p><p><strong>Let us splash for our span on the shore of forever and adore these sore bones that hold us up. </strong>Let us play in the waves of wonder and boom our wishes from one mountain to another. Everywhere we meet, we form new niches for the Universe to pour in and fill with possibilities we could not have imagined.</p><p><strong>What a gift in every second spent here with you, spinning together through space. What myths shall we make of our lives today?</strong></p><p>***</p><p>So, I've recently begun to think of my heart as a tunnel through a mountain by the sea...</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">Existential Inquiry Radio</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
